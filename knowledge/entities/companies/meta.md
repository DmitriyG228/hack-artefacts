## Meeting Mentions
- 2024-05-17 — The US Government and Stablecoins: Key flashpoint in stablecoin policy history. June 2019 white paper for Libra sparked Congressional opposition. Maxine Waters and Sherrod Brown warned of "shadow currency" and shadow banking risks. Comparison to 2008 financial crisis rhetoric. Company's poor reputation for data practices amplified Congressional concern. Libra 2.0 pivot (June 2020) attempted to address securities classification concerns by moving to single-currency pegs. Rebranding to Diem (2020) and eventual project abandonment by end-2020 marked end of this narrative phase but established regulatory pattern.

## Key Controversy
- Congressional concern about Facebook setting up parallel financial system
- Visceral reaction tied to company's data privacy scandals
- Positioned as "shadow bank" and threat to US dollar dominance
- Led to bipartisan Congressional opposition (Waters, Brown)
