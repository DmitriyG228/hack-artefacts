- Bipartisan consensus on payment stablecoins appears strong, but Fed regulatory role remains contested between House (Republicans) and Senate (Democrats) versions
- Several Q&A participants raised technical and economic questions not fully resolved in current legislative proposals
- Perry Merling's research on par and eurodollars recommended as essential reading for understanding stablecoin stability mechanisms
