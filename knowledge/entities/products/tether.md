- **Status:** Active / Dominant market position
- **Maintained by:** Tether Holdings Limited

## Meeting Mentions
- 2024-05-17 — The US Government and Stablecoins: Referenced as primary target of "wildcat money" narrative (2020-2021) after Diem's collapse. Congressional concern shifted from Facebook's global ambitions to domestic uncontrolled stablecoins like Tether. Noted as "totally out of control" by Franklin Noll. Central to debate on reserve adequacy and seigniorage concerns (~$110B in T-bills held as reserves).

## Key Issues Discussed
- Regulatory concern about par maintenance under stress
- Reserve composition and adequacy for maintaining dollar peg
- Seigniorage: T-bills held as Tether reserves would generate interest (~$5.5B at current rates) that transfers to Treasury if peg breaks
- Comparison to money market fund issues (2008); risk of runs under systemic stress
- Cross-border implications of offshore stablecoin dominance
