### Meeting Opening & Ground Rules
The meeting began with moderator remarks on meeting conduct: participants must treat each other with rationality and respect, disagree respectfully with evidence-based arguments rather than opinion. The presenter's personal views were noted as separate from their employer positions.

### Stablecoin Narrative Evolution (2019-2026)

#### Narrative Arc Breakdown

**Phase 1: Shadow Money (2019-2020)**
- Triggered by Facebook's Libra whitepaper announcement (June 2019)
- Congressional reaction: severe skepticism and regulatory pushback
- Dominant narrative: stablecoins as risk to financial stability, threat to monetary policy
- Key event: Congressional backlash against Libra (July-September 2019)

**Phase 2: Wildcat Money (2020-2021)**
- Narrative shift after Libra 2.0/Diem pivot (June 2020)
- Focus on risks of unregulated money creation
- Key regulatory events:
  - OCC interpretive letters supporting stablecoins (September 2020, January 2021)
  - Regulatory framework starting to take shape
- Question remained: "Should we allow this at all?"

**Phase 3: Future Money/Money of the Future (2021-2026)**
- Fundamental shift post-November 2021 (President's Working Group on Stablecoins framework)
- New question: "How do we enable and regulate this for US competitive advantage?"
- Recognition of stablecoins as strategic asset for USD hegemony
- Congressional pivot from "ban" to "regulate and enable"
- Bipartisan acceleration of regulatory framework

### Congressional Legislative Positions

**Key Legislation Tracked:**
- **HR 5197**: Proposed redefinition of certain stablecoins as securities
- **Stablecoin Act**: Regulatory framework legislation with reserve, transparency, and operational requirements
- **Rep. Maxine Waters**: Supportive of regulation but cautious on enabling stablecoins
- **Sen. Sherrod Brown**: Focus on banking/consumer protection angles
- **Rep. Sylvia Garcia**: Strong regulatory stance
- **Rep. Patrick McHenry**: More permissive/enabling approach to stablecoin innovation

**Decision**: Bipartisan consensus emerged toward structured regulation enabling stablecoins rather than prohibition.

### Real-World Use Cases & Demand

**Primary Use Case: Remittances**
- USDC and other stablecoins currently used in wallet remittance systems
- [[Stellar]] remittance system for cross-border payments
- Lower transaction costs compared to traditional rails
- Evidence of product-market fit: actual remittance flows into stablecoins

**Secondary Use Cases Discussed:**
- DeFi collateral backing
- Local private currencies (Pittsburgh example cited)
- Cross-border transaction settlement
- Alternative to Eurodollar systems

### Regulatory & Technical Questions

**CBDCs vs. Stablecoins**
- Multiple attendees asked relationship between Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins
- [[Franklin Noll]] explained stablecoins fill different use cases; not direct competitors for government-issued digital currencies
- US strategy: dominate both stablecoin AND CBDC technology

**Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP)**
- Question raised about SATP compliance and interoperability standards
- [[Franklin Noll]] noted importance of settlement standards for institutional adoption

**Par Stability Mechanisms**
- Discussion of how stablecoins maintain parity with USD
- Reference to Perry Merlin's "On Par" paper for detailed mechanisms
- Question of reserve duration vs. traditional demand deposit requirements

**Cross-Border Regulation**
- [[Alexander Glo]] raised concern about regulatory treatment of cross-border stablecoin transactions
- Potential friction points with foreign regulator policies

### Reserve & Transparency Requirements

- Stablecoin Bill includes provisions for reserve backing requirements
- Emphasis on transparency of reserve composition
- Discussion of par reserve duration (how quickly can be redeemed at face value)
- Contrast with Eurodollar systems (comparison to Federal Reserve 2022 "Fit for Purpose" paper)

### International Competitiveness

- **Strategic Goal**: US dominance in stablecoin technology globally
- **Reasoning**: USD-pegged stablecoins strengthen dollar hegemony and provide payment infrastructure alternative to other nations' systems
- **Competitive Frame**: This is a strategic advantage in digital economy vs. China, EU, and other nation-states developing their own payment rails

## Key Decisions
- **Policy Shift**: Congressional consensus moved from "prohibit stablecoins" (2019-2020) to "regulate and enable stablecoins" (2021-2026)
- **Regulatory Approach**: Structured statutory framework (Stablecoin Act/HR 5197) rather than prohibition or ad-hoc regulation
- **Strategic Framing**: Stablecoins repositioned as critical infrastructure for USD dominance and US payments innovation
