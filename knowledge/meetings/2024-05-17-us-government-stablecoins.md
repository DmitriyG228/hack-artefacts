**Date:** 2024-05-17
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours (presentation + Q&A)
**Recording:** Not provided

## TL;DR
Franklin Noll traces how US government narratives around stablecoins have shifted dramatically from viewing them as "shadow money" threatening the dollar (2019) to positioning them as essential infrastructure for US competitiveness (2024). The shift reflects changing Congressional sentiment, regulatory framework development, and bipartisan consensus on payment stablecoins pegged to the USD.

### The Three Narratives Framework (2019-2024)

**Narrative 1: "Shadow Money" (2019-2020)**
- **Context:** Facebook's Libra proposal (June 2019) sparked Congressional reaction
- **Characteristics:** Global stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies; consortium of 40 companies including Visa and PayPal
- **Congressional Response:** Framed as "Shadow Banking" and threat to USD dominance; viewed as potential financial crisis catalyst
- **Key Figures:** Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) led opposition
- **Regulatory Approach:** HR 5197 proposed redefining stablecoins as securities (due to multi-currency basket structure)
- **Outcome:** Libra 2.0 (June 2020) pivoted to multiple single-currency pegs; rebranded to Diem; ultimately abandoned by end-2020

**Narrative 2: "Wildcat Money" (2020-2021)**
- **Context:** Post-Diem, focus shifted to domestic US stablecoins like Tether; OCC issued supportive interpretive letters
- **Key Events:**
  - September 2020: Brian Brooks (OCC) issues interpretive letter allowing national banks to hold stablecoin reserves
  - January 2021: OCC letter suggests stablecoins function like traveler's checks
- **Regulatory Model:** Compared to Free Banking Era (pre-Civil War); wildcat banks issued private currencies with variable value
- **Academic Influence:** Gorton & Jiang (2021) paper "Taming Wildcat Stablecoins" introduces "no questions asked" (NQA) principle
- **Congressional Response:** HR 8827 (STABLE Act) by Rep. Talib Lynch, Rep. Garcia, Rep. Maxine Waters proposes regulating stablecoins as pseudo-banks or requiring FDIC insurance
- **Key Concept:** If multiple stablecoins exist with different redemption terms, they'll break monetary unity; solution is to treat issuers like national banks

**Narrative 3: "Future Money" (2021-2024)**
- **Catalyst:** November 2021 - White House Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets defines "payment stablecoins"
- **Definition:** Stablecoins pegged to fiat currency, widely used as medium of exchange, issued by centralized entity (non-decentralized)
- **Key Bills:**
  - S534 (Pat Toomey, R-PA): Defines payment stablecoins; removes securities classification if conditions met
  - HR 4766 (Patrick McKenry, R-OH): "Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act" (passed House Committee Summer 2023)
  - Lumis-Gillibrand Act (Senate): Bipartisan approach with Fed involvement in all stablecoin oversight
- **Regulatory Consensus:** Bipartisan support (Dems and Republicans) for payment stablecoins; debate centers on Fed's regulatory role
- **Quotes & Positioning:**
  - Nelly Liang (Treasury Under Secretary): "Cornerstone of new payment system"
  - Patrick McKenry: "Pillar of our 21st century payment system"
- **Key Shift:** No longer needs to be a bank; can be "regulated entity"; seen as tool to maintain USD supremacy globally

### Key Decisions
- **From Ban to Regulation:** Congress shifted from attempting to ban stablecoins (2019) to establishing regulatory frameworks (2022-2024)
- **Bipartisan Consensus:** Payment stablecoins (pegged to USD, domestically controlled) now have support from both Democrats and Republicans
- **Fed Involvement:** Debate centers on whether all stablecoin issuers need Fed accounts (Lumis-Gillibrand) vs. state regulation + bank charters (Toomey)
- **USD Competitiveness:** Framing shifted to stablecoins as key to maintaining US dollar dominance in global payments

### Q&A Themes

**CBDCs vs. Stablecoins:**
- Q: How do narrative changes relate to surge in CBDC development? (Alonso)
- A: Timing correlation suggests potential partisan dynamics: if Democrats push CBDCs, Republicans counter with privately-issued stablecoins as alternative to digital dollar

**Use Cases and Real-World Problems:**
- Q: What problem do stablecoins solve that can't be solved within existing payment rails? (Alexander Gloye)
- A: Current primary use case is remittances (e.g., Stellar, Circle USDC); allows wallet-to-wallet transfers without intermediary banks. Retail payment case (e.g., Starbucks) not yet compelling vs. existing digital payment methods.
- A: Local private currencies could offer compelling use case (e.g., Pittsburgh issues stablecoin, revenue funds local infrastructure)
- A: Stablecoins on blockchain/DLT enable transactions impossible on traditional payment rails

**Par Stability and Systemic Risk:**
- Q: Counterpoint on transaction costs and par maintenance
- A: Stablecoins show history of breaking par (like money market funds in 2008); relies on highest form of money (central bank money) to maintain peg; under stress, private money systems become vulnerable
- A: Fed seigniorage: $110B in T-bills held as stablecoin reserves; if peg breaks, this transfers to Treasury (~$5.5B at current rates) but Fed doesn't trade T-bills for stablecoin gains; this is side effect of monetary policy

**Interoperability and Cross-Border:**
- Q: Will upcoming US regulation permit cross-border transactions?
- A: Not explicitly discussed in current bills; Congress focused on domestic stability and AML/KYC compliance. If US-pegged stablecoins become global, this becomes USD dominance tool.
- A: Must read: Perry Merling's paper on par comparing stablecoins to eurodollars; maintains that interoperability mechanisms and culture/strategy matter as much as technology

**Regulatory Framework Details:**
- Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) mentioned as potential interoperability solution
- Federal Reserve paper "Fit for Purpose" (2022) already addresses payment system mechanisms and par maintenance

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Monitor Lumis-Gillibrand Act progress in Senate | Unassigned | Ongoing | Open |
| Track HR 4766 floor vote timeline in House | Unassigned | 2024 | Open |
| Research interoperability mechanisms (SATP, Merling par framework) | Unassigned | TBD | Open |
| Review Federal Reserve "Fit for Purpose" payment system paper | Unassigned | TBD | Open |
| Monitor Fed regulatory approach to stablecoin reserve requirements | Unassigned | Ongoing | Open |

## Key Takeaways
- Narrative frames policy discourse: "shadow money" → "wildcat money" → "future money" reflects evolving Congressional risk perception
- 2021 turning point: Bull market (Coinbase IPO, NFTs, metaverse) combined with White House working group shifted tone from threat to infrastructure
- Bipartisan consensus on payment stablecoins (not CBDC) reflects both parties' interest in USD dominance and competitive advantage vs. other digital assets
- Regulatory debate remains: Fed role, reserve requirements, cross-border implications still being worked out
- Par stability and interoperability mechanisms are critical but underexplored in Congressional discussions
