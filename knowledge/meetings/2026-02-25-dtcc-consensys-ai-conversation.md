## Discussion

### Historical Context: 10 Years of Blockchain Journey (2016–2026)

[[Michael Casey]] opened by reflecting on his attendance at the very first Hyperledger meeting in 2016, when [[IBM]] announced [[Hyperledger Fabric]]. He noted the interesting contrast between the two speakers' perspectives: [[Brian Steele]] representing the traditional finance (TradFi) world and [[DTCC]]'s centralized trust infrastructure, and [[Joe Lubin]] representing the crypto/blockchain upstart ecosystem.

**Key Point (Joe):** Joe acknowledged that early on, there was significant tension between these worlds. He framed the core issue as trust:
- DTCC and centralized institutions are founded on centralized trust (the system works because institutions are trusted)
- Bitcoin (2008-2009) and Ethereum introduced decentralized trust mechanisms
- Both approaches are "on the same team" trying to build better systems, just from different angles

**Key Point (Brian):** DTCC has been involved since January 2016 (under [[Rob Palatnik]]'s leadership), now under [[John Powell]]. DTCC's core mission is custody and settlement of 100+ trillion in US equities. The firm faces an inherent obligation: as technology evolves, DTCC must evolve or face disruption.

### DTCC's Tokenization Roadmap

[[Brian Steele]] outlined DTCC's strategy for tokenization:

- **Scope:** Enable tokenization of the 100 trillion in assets currently held at DTCC
- **Multi-L1 Integration:** DTCC will not align to a single Layer 1 network. Instead, it will integrate with various L1s (Ethereum, Canton, others)
- **Wallet Flexibility:** Tokenized assets will live in wallets of clients' choice or their clients' clients' choice
- **Activity Across Networks:** Enable activity on any L1 that DTCC integrates with
- **Philosophy:** Enabling clients' digital assets journey, not disrupting existing actors; bridging TradFi and DeFi

**Compliance Approach:** DTCC maintains full KYC/AML perimeter despite tokenization:
- Not creating bearer instruments (anonymous assets)
- Maintaining same KYC/AML requirements that regulators are comfortable with
- Wallet transfers permitted only between registered wallets in DTCC's service

### Regulatory Catalyst: SEC No-Action Letter

A major turning point was the SEC no-action letter (issued just before the holiday break in late 2025). [[Brian Steele]] emphasized:
- This provides regulatory certainty, not just regulatory guidance
- DTCC had been working "on the sidelines with anticipation" that this clarity would come
- The announcement positioned everything as "ready to go, just needed the no-action letter"
- Post-announcement, DTCC received "tremendous inbound" from clients wanting to engage meaningfully

**Context:** [[Joe Lubin]] highlighted the broader regulatory shift in the US under the current administration. After the SEC transitioned from the Gendler to Atkins administration, and with growing stablecoin adoption, regulatory uncertainty decreased dramatically.

### Market Sentiment: TradFi and DeFi Convergence

[[Joe Lubin]] described the convergence drivers:
- **Stablecoin Growth:** Stablecoins grew significantly in total asset value
- **Bank Panic:** Mid-sized regional banks worried about deposit flight to stablecoins
- **Swift's Response:** SWIFT recognized the concern and formulated a response; Consensys was asked to prototype a SWIFT ledger
- **Public Permission:** Javier Taso Perez announced SWIFT's breakthrough project at CyOS in Frankfurt, effectively giving everyone "permission" to talk about TradFi-DeFi integration

[[Brian Steele]] noted positive sentiment from both DeFi and TradFi communities regarding DTCC's tokenization offering:
- Interest from DeFi community to become direct members of DTCC or leverage existing 300+ direct participants
- DTCC sees itself as bridging the two worlds, not limiting to existing TradFi actors

### Technical Architecture: From Enterprise Blockchain to Layer 2s

[[Joe Lubin]] reflected on the evolution of enterprise blockchain:
- Early 2010s: Hyperledger Foundation and [[Enterprise Ethereum Alliance]] focused on private, permissioned blockchain systems
- **Outcome:** Most projects tried and failed because sufficient trust wasn't achievable in closed ecosystems
- **Pivot:** Declaration that "enterprise blockchain is dead; long live enterprise blockchain"
- **New Model:** Rollup-centric roadmap on Ethereum enables:
  - Sufficiently decentralized Layer 2 systems
  - Full inheritance of Ethereum's trust guarantees
  - Interoperability across the Ethereum ecosystem
  - Appropriate architecture for enterprise use cases

**Joe's Vision for Token Metadata:** Joe speculated that DTCC might evolve into a protocol defining metadata structures for tokenized assets:
- NFTs representing different denominations of equities (1 share, 100 shares)
- NFT containers holding metadata that dictates trading rules, venue, timing
- Cross-asset trading (e.g., apple shares against bananas) without rigidly structured venues
- DTCC evolving from infrastructure operator to protocol/mechanism designer

([[Brian Steele]] responded humorously: "I probably won't be working here" if that vision fully materializes, but acknowledged the possibility.)

### Market Structure Transformation

[[Brian Steele]] described a fundamental shift in how financial services will operate:
- **Current State:** Market structure built on three dimensions: asset class, geography, regulator
- **Future State:** Regulator still exists, but asset-class and geographic boundaries will "completely democratize"
- **Radical Shift:** Current inefficiencies—capital "bottled up" in structured pipelines—will dissolve
- **Implication:** Everything from equities to futures to options to swaps to financing could operate in a single, integrated market structure

[[Michael Casey]] clarified: "So you're talking about the entire economy?" [[Brian Steele]] confirmed: "Essentially, yes—tokenized assets of any type flowing through the same market structure."

[[Brian Steele]] emphasized that DTCC's role will evolve through partnership, not conquest:
- Starting with DTCC's strength: securities settlement in the US
- Beginning with 100 trillion in assets on blockchain rails
- But expansion beyond that requires partnership with other ecosystem actors
- "It's not a DTCC conquers the world exercise."

### AI Agents and Decentralized Finance

[[Michael Casey]] pivoted to the "elephant in the room": AI. He noted that tokenized assets with programmable money and metadata create the perfect framework for AI agents to operate autonomously. He raised a core concern: How do we ensure human agency and control over AI systems?

**Joe Lubin's Vision:**

- **Current State:** Centralized organizations building foundational models and AI user interfaces
- **Problem:** Big tech's social media polarization demonstrates risks of centralized control
- **Solution:** Move much of AI infrastructure onto decentralized rails
- **Mechanisms Being Built:**
  - Protocols enabling agents to pay one another
  - Agent self-registration and capability declaration
  - Reputation systems (agents, humans, companies provide feedback)
  - Digital twins: Personal AI agents representing individuals across Web2 and Web3
  - AI agents acting as tutors, mentors, information filters

**Long-term Vision:**
- We're in the tail end of an 80-year debt super cycle (since WWII)
- Next super cycle's dominant technologies: AI + decentralized protocols
- These enable real agency for people and companies in financial, economic, social, and political domains
- AI agents filter information, reducing fake news and polarization
- Humans working in collectives with biological and machine intelligence (hybrid ASI—Artificial Super Intelligence)

**Key Insight:** Joe argued that regulatory restrictions and centralized control of AI models pose existential risks. Decentralized AI protocols with human-controlled representatives will provide better outcomes.

### DTCC's Trust Responsibility in the AI Era

[[Michael Casey]] asked [[Brian Steele]] to close on DTCC's obligation to ensure human trust and agency in this new world.

[[Brian Steele]]'s Response:
- **Existential Premise:** If trust in DTCC fails, there's no point in having DTCC as an organization
- **Unique Value:** DTCC's ownership structure and governance are designed solely to build ecosystem trust—not commercial interests
- **Differentiation:** Unlike public or private companies with commercial motivations, DTCC is motivated by "what's good for the industry"
- **Application to AI:** This unique structure positions DTCC to be a trusted partner as systems become more complex and autonomous

## Key Decisions
- **Tokenization Path:** DTCC to proceed with multi-L1 tokenization service for equities (100 trillion asset base)
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Maintain KYC/AML perimeter in tokenized environment; no bearer instruments
- **Ecosystem Approach:** Bridge TradFi and DeFi; enable new actors (including DeFi protocols/entities) to participate directly or through existing members
- **Market Structure Evolution:** Accept fundamental shift toward democratized, geographically unrestricted, asset-agnostic market structure
- **Trust Foundation:** Reaffirm DTCC's role as trust infrastructure ensuring human agency in financial markets, including AI-driven futures
