# Libra / Diem

- **Description:** Global stablecoin project initially proposed by Facebook (Meta), intended to be backed by a basket of currencies and operated by a consortium of companies. Later pivoted to multiple single-currency pegs before abandonment.
- **Status:** Deprecated (abandoned by end of 2020)
- **Maintained by:** Facebook / Meta

## Development Timeline
- **June 2019:** White paper released; backed by basket of currencies; consortium of 40 companies (Visa, PayPal, etc.)
- **2019-2020:** Congressional opposition led by Maxine Waters and Sherrod Brown; framed as "shadow currency" and banking threat
- **HR 5197:** Proposal to classify stablecoins as securities (due to multi-currency basket and managed structure)
- **June 2020:** Libra 2.0 pivot — restructured to multiple single-currency pegs (pegged to specific fiat currencies) to address regulatory concerns
- **Rebranding:** Project renamed to "Diem"
- **End 2020:** Project effectively dead; rebranding to Diem did not gain traction

## Meeting Mentions
- 2024-05-17 — The US Government and Stablecoins: Analyzed as originating narrative of "shadow money" (2019-2020). Congressional reaction represented visceral concern about Facebook setting up shadow banking system; comparison to 2008 financial crisis rhetoric. Served as catalyst for first wave of Congressional stablecoin bills (HR 5197).

## Key Takeaways
- First major stablecoin policy flashpoint in US government
- Represented shift from retail payment to global currency ambitions
- Congressional response focused on securities classification (multi-currency basket) and shadow banking risks
- Abandonment cleared regulatory space for subsequent single-currency stablecoin frameworks
